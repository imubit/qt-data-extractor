# Industrial Data Extractor

Industrial Data Extractor is an open-source Windows application to extract process data from industrial systems
and historians.

The following systems are currently supported:

* [Osisoft PI](https://github.com/imubit/data-agent-osisoft-pi)
* [AspenTech InfoPlus.21](https://github.com/imubit/data-agent-aspen-ip21)

It supports browsing and selecting tags on the target system and extract periods of data into zipped CSVs.

## Installation

Please use https://github.com/imubit/qt-data-extractor/releases to download the latest version of the extractor.

## Getting Started

* Configure the target historian using `Server` drop down.
* Using left panel filter editor to browse for tags or import an Excel sheet with a list of tags.
* Select tags you would like to extract on left panel and add then to the right panel with `Add to Selected Tags` button.
* Select a period to be extracted and sample rate (use `Raw Data` option to extract the original sample rate that is stored within the historian).
* Select `Save Directory` in which your archive will be populated.
* Click `Extract` and confirm your selection.
* Wait until extraction is finished.

### Osisoft PI historian prerequisites

Please make sure you have [PI SDK](https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Products/PI-System-Access/PI-SDK/Overview) and AF SDK installed and configured on your workstation before attempting to access PI historian


## Development

### Python Install

Python package distribution is available in addition to Windows installer.

```python
pip install qt-data-extractor
```

### Running under CLI

```
PS C:\> qt-data-extractor
```

* If the application is not starting this way, Python Scripts directory is probably not in the PATH. In this case you can run the script from Python installation directory (i.e. `c:\Python\Python39\Scripts\qt-data-extractor.exe`)

### Building Windows Executable

```bash
pipx run tox -e winexe
```
